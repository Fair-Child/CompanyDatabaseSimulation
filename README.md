A Simulation Database Frame of Company

The COMPANY database records and keeps track of a company’s employees, departments, and projects. After the requirements collection and analysis phase, suppose that the designers (you and your team) are convinced that among other concepts, your database should represent the following information. 

The company has departments, each having a unique name, unique number, and a specific employee who manages it. We would like to keep track of the start date of each department manager.

A department may have several locations. A department is in charge of a number of projects, each of which has a unique name, a unique ID, and a single location assigned to each project. 

The database should at least record the following information about each employee: name, birthdate, social insurance number (SIN), address, home or cell phone number, salary and gender. 

Each employee is assigned to one department but he/she may work on different projects in the company, not necessarily assigned to the employee’s department. We would like to keep track of the hours an employee worked on each project as well as the direct supervisor of each employee (who is another employee). 

For insurance and benefits reasons, the database should also record and keep track of information about employees’ dependents. Such information should include, for instance, name, gender, data of birth, SIN number. As the company grows, keeping track of different project’s phases and progress becomes more difficult without a data management application system. You are encouraged to consider other concepts that may be relevant and useful to this application and include them in your running system. Present your design in an E/R diagram and underline the ke attributes. Covnvert your database conceptual design (the E/R) into relations and analyse the relations which you decide to keep to support the application based on the FDs on each relation. Normalize the relations into BCNF (or 3NF) and present your final database scheme, with non-trivial FDs on each relation, and the key attributes. Express constraints that exists in each table or among different tables. To be more precise, your report should include the steps followed during the design process and implementation details, reiterated as follows.
